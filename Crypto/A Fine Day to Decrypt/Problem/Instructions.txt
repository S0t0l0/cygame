The attached ciphertext was intercepted by our systems, and we suspect it contains the works of our adversaries.  Moreover, it seems our adversaries are somehow using a particular polynomial to encrypt their messages (byte by byte):

  E(x) = (21*x + 73) mod 128

Will you be able to decrypt the ciphertext?
(See encryptSnippet.py for a sample implementation of this encryption method.)
