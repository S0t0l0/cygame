This challenge has three (nonstackable) flags to choose from:

1. cygame{"@ASCII...ascii...123}
-- OR -- 
2. cygame{"@ASCII...ascii...1234...!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?[]^_`{|}
-- OR --
3. cygame{"@ASCII...ascii...1234...!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?[]^_`{|}~}

NOTES: 
Flag 1 exists because with the given affine E(x) = 21*x + 73, the character '4' will map to the carriage return, denoted as '\r'. 
If someone were to copy-and-paste the ciphertext or read the file as a non-binary file, '\r' would instead take the form of '\n' (which maps back to '}')
To avoid this problem, we must read the ciphertext as a binary file.
Still, this detail was deemed to nuanced for such a challenge, so this first flag was added.

Flag 2 and 3 exists because of an oversight during creation (the character '}' should not be included in future flags).
