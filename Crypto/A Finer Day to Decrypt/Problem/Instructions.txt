It seems the target has increased the amount of characters they can support with their encryption methods.  So far, we have managed to recover their new encryption polynomial:

  E(x) = (489891*x + 534965) mod 1114111.

However, we still need to find a way to reverse it to glean information from the attached ciphertext.
