## Challenge Categories
The Cyber Games CTF offers challenges in the following categories, designed to test a wide range of technical skills and knowledge:
* __Web__
* __Reverse Engineering (RE)__
* __Forensics (For)__
* __Cryptography (Crypto)__
* __Miscellaneous (Misc)__

As a developer, your role is to create engaging challenges within these categories that will push participants to their limits and enhance their cybersecurity expertise.

## Capturing the Flag
The essence of the Cyber Games CTF is capturing the flag. Participants will encounter various obstacles, puzzles, and traps, each hiding a unique flag. To prove their mastery, participants must capture the flag by submitting the flag's code wrapped in the format __cygame{}__. It is important to ensure that the flag submission format is consistent across all challenges.

## Development Workflow and Repository
To streamline the development process, we utilize a version-controlled approach using GitHub. All challenge development should be done in the __"Challenges"__ branch within the repository. A comprehensive development guide is available in the __README__ of the __"Challenges"__ branch. It provides essential instructions and guidelines for creating challenges, including:
* Challenge creation and design principles
* Flag submission format and validation
* Integration with the challenge framework
* Testing and deployment procedures

Please refer to the development guide in the __"Challenges"__ branch for detailed information on developing challenges.

## Temporary Remote Development Environment
To facilitate testing and development, a remote development environment is provided for all developers. The environment is as follows:
* __System Name__: cygame-dev-lxc
* __SSH__: ambercaravalho.com:22

For login information and access to the remote development environment, please contact Amber Caravalho.

## Prepare for Battle!
As a developer or maintainer of the JBLE Cyber Games CTF, you play a crucial role in creating an exhilarating cyber battle environment. The challenges you develop will push participants to their limits and contribute to the success of the competition. Stay focused, think creatively, and remember the flag format: __cygame{}__.
