Proxy Zealots

Scouting Evidence

Nothing in their base except for maybe a pylon.

As Terran

Wall off if they aren’t in your base. If you get a solid wall off, a few marines attacking and SCVs repairing will shut this down completely. If you can’t wall off, build a bunker at each end of your minerals. Use your SCVs to repair the bunkers as needed. I prefer to get marauders for the range, but reapers have a higher DPS and can kite zealots. Get a reaper into his base to destroy his economy and you’re good to go.

As Zerg

Get your pool down as soon as you scout it, then make at least one spinecrawler. If you can defend with two spinecrawlers and a few lings send your lings to his base and wipe out his probes. Getting roaches out will completely shut him down.

As Protoss

Make a choke point with enough space for 1 zealot at the thinnest point and get a forge out for 1 cannon. Keep chronoboosting zealots and try to limit your cannons to just 1. Pull probes as needed as he will certainly have a higher zealot count than you. If you can’t get the choke or he built in your base, then build a cannon or two near your mineral line, and keep pumping zealots. If you an afford to send one zealot to his base, you’re good to go.
